# Personal Profile

## Description

This repo contains the code for my personal website used to promote myself and showcase my skills and projects. This was created in order to further my knowledge of css and create the basis for a page to advertise myself on.
I learned a lot about how important it is to creating the HTML structure before moving forward, as I came into a lot of issues and messier code because I decided to hop into css much too early. In the future I will keep in mind the importance of wireframing and HTML.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

Using this webpage should be intuitive, as I attempted to use universal design language. The navigation menu for larger displays uses a fixed bar at the top with clickable links that will bring you to the desired section. 
On mobile devices, the bar is replaced by a hamburger menu that needs to be accessed before the navigation options are offered.

Projects are all clickable and bring you to the websites where they are deployed.
